# Australian TV and Digital Radio logo icons

These flat icons are designed with Kodi and Tvheadend in mind but would be useful wherever these types of graphics are needed.

## Missing Icons or Updates

If you are using Tvheadend you can download a list of channels in M3U format. Go to "tvheadend-ip-address:9981/playlist" Since the icons are matched using the channel name this M3U file is perfect for creating or matching any missing icons.
